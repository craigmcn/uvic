# Portfolio

The portfolio consists of sample code files and screenshots from three projects. The first two are from the University of Saskatchewan and the last is a personal project. The university has begun using a new framework that is a slightly re-worked copy of Twitter Bootstrap. I prefer Bootstrap for my application projects because a specific style is rarely necessary and Bootstrap provides a clean design that includes all potential elements I've needed, with simple customization available in-line (as necessary) or with custom javascript (jQuery).
